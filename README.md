# CS284: Software Modeling and Analysis تحليل ونمذجة البرمجيات
Spring 2021
## Course Objectives:
Having successfully completed this course, the student will be able to:
* Introduces modeling and analysis as core concepts in software engineering discipline.
* Analyze software system requirements using software requirement models.
* Design software system architecture, classes and processes using the appropriate models.
* Create the above models using software engineering tools.

## Course Description:
This course introduces modeling and analysis as core concepts in software engineering discipline. How these concepts can be first applied to the analysis, specification, and validation of requirements. Highlights the construction of requirements, which includes an analysis of the feasibility of the desired system, elicitation and analysis of stakeholders' needs, the creation of a precise description of what the system should and should not do along with any constraints on its operation and implementation, and the validation of this description or specification by the stakeholders.

## Topics Covered:
### Lectures:
* Introduction (Modeling principles (e.g. decomposition, abstraction, generalization, etc.), Modeling languages, Types of models (e.g. information modeling , behavioral modeling, etc.))
* Requirements (Functional & Non-functional, Requirements elicitation techniques).
* Requirements specification and specification languages (e.g. structured English, UML, formal, etc.)
* Functional models, Structural models in analysis, Behavioral models in analysis
* Analysis fundamentals including prioritization, trade-off analysis, risk analysis, and impact analysis; Validating analysis models
* Design concepts, principles and strategies
* OO modeling and design using UML
* Architectural styles, patterns, reuse

### Laboratories:
* Give an idea about some tools that are used in software development life cycle.
* Acquire basic concepts of UML.
* Practice with UML models
* Use a selected tool such as [ArgoUML](https://www.filehorse.com/download-argouml/) or [Umbrello](https://umbrello.kde.org/) to produce different models used in OO software analysis and design such as: (a) Use case, (b) Sequence diagram, (c) Activity diagram, (d) Class diagram, etc.
* Mini projects (done by groups of -3 students and carry - marks)

## Needed Software
You can choose one of the following softwares as they all working with the same notation used in the book
### Umbrello Setup
You can download whatever version suitable to your device from [here](https://umbrello.kde.org/)
### ArgoUML Setup
You may need to follow the following instructions
* Install Jave Runtime Environment (JRE) from [here](https://java-2-runtime-environment.ar.uptodown.com/windows). 
* Install ArgoUML from [here](./SW/ArgoUML-0.34-setup.exe).
### Online
#### Lucidchart
You can work online on [this website](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) and draw the diagrams for free, but it needs registeration. 
#### Draw.io
Also you can work on the cloud version of [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) for sketching your drawings. You can work directly online without registeration.

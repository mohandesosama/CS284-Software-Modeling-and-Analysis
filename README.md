# CS284: Software Modeling and Analysis تحليل ونمذجة البرمجيات
## Course Objectives:
Having successfully completed this course, the student will be able to:
* Introduces modeling and analysis as core concepts in software engineering discipline.
* Analyze software system requirements using software requirement models.
* Design software system architecture, classes and processes using the appropriate models.
* Create the above models using software engineering tools.

## Course Description:
This course introduces modeling and analysis as core concepts in software engineering discipline. How these concepts can be first applied to the analysis, specification, and validation of requirements. Highlights the construction of requirements, which includes an analysis of the feasibility of the desired system, elicitation and analysis of stakeholders' needs, the creation of a precise description of what the system should and should not do along with any constraints on its operation and implementation, and the validation of this description or specification by the stakeholders.

## Topics Covered:
### Lectures:
* Introduction (Modeling principles (e.g. decomposition, abstraction, generalization, etc.), Modeling languages, Types of models (e.g. information modeling , behavioral modeling, etc.))
* Requirements (Functional & Non-functional, Requirements elicitation techniques).
* Requirements specification and specification languages (e.g. structured English, UML, formal, etc.)
* Functional models, Structural models in analysis, Behavioral models in analysis
* Analysis fundamentals including prioritization, trade-off analysis, risk analysis, and impact analysis; Validating analysis models
* Design concepts, principles and strategies
* OO modeling and design using UML
* Architectural styles, patterns, reuse

### Laboratories:
* Give an idea about some tools that are used in software development life cycle.
* Acquire basic concepts of UML.
* Practice with UML models
* Use a selected tool such as ArgoUML [[Download ArgoUML](./SW/ArgoUML-0.34-setup.exe)] to produce different models used in OO software analysis and design such as: (a) Use case, (b) Sequence diagram, (c) Activity diagram, (d) Class diagram, etc.
* Mini projects (done by groups of -3 students and carry - marks)
